I"m<p>Hi, my name is Joel. I was the 2021-2022 Digital Humanities Associate Fellow, Levine Institute for Holocaust Education and Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I am currently working on a project on how newspapers varied headlines in Associated Press wire copy during key moments in the American reporting of the Holocaust. I’ll be staying another year to continue my research and to help out with digital projects at the museum.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May of 2021, where I completed a double major in Computer Science and English Literature. Most of my academic and technical work was done with the <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Price Lab for Digital Humanities</a> and Penn Libraries’ <a href="https://guides.library.upenn.edu/digital-scholarship" target="_blank">Research Data and Digital Scholarship</a> team, where I worked on a variety of DH projects in the humanities and arts.</p>

<p>I am currently located in DC and in my free time I like to bike, read asian american fiction, and play piano. I teach piano at the <a href="https://www.sitarartscenter.org/" target="_blank">Sitar Arts Center</a> in DC and am a Collaborative Development Editor at <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a>.</p>

<p>I had the privilege to work with and be mentored by <a href="https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/in-memoriam/jonathan-scott-enderle" target="_blank">Scott Enderle</a>, whose life, work, and kindness I will always remember. Without him I would have never been involved in DH, and I dedicate my work to his consistent care, support, and encouragement. You can listen to a podcast in memorium of him <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I1LNJwjAj5NomAzFihRgU" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
