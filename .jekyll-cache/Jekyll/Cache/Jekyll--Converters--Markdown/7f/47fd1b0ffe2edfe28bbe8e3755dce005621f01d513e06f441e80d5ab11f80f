I"“<p>Hi, my name is Joel. I am the Data Engineer in the <a href="https://dsg.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Scholarship Group</a> at <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern Library</a>. Previously, I was a researcher in Digital Humanities and the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/research/opportunities-for-academics/fellowships/digital" target="_blank">2021-2022 Digital Humanities Associate Fellow</a> at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. There, I worked on a project on how newspapers varied headlines in Associated Press wire copy during key moments in the American reporting of the Holocaust, as well other innovative digital projects at the museum.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May of 2021, where I completed a double major in Computer Science and English Literature. Most of my academic and technical work was done with the <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Price Lab for Digital Humanities</a> and Penn Librariesâ€™ <a href="https://guides.library.upenn.edu/digital-scholarship" target="_blank">Research Data and Digital Scholarship</a> team, where I worked on a variety of DH projects in the humanities and arts.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to play jazz piano, and I love to volunteer and teach piano to students!</p>

<p>I am also always happy to help students, especially undergraduates who are interested in Digital Humanities. Navigating this work as a student in college can be a confusing process. If you are an undergraduate thinking of working or studying Digital Humanities, please feel free to reach out to me and Iâ€™m happy to share resources and my experiences.</p>

<p>I had the privilege to work with and be mentored by <a href="https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/in-memoriam/jonathan-scott-enderle" target="_blank">Scott Enderle</a>, whose life, work, and kindness I will always remember. Without him I would have never been involved in DH, and I dedicate my work to his consistent care, support, and encouragement. You can listen to a podcast in memorium of him <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I1LNJwjAj5NomAzFihRgU" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
