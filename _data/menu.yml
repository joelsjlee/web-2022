  - title: Hi, my name is Joel! I work in the <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/digital_scholarship/digital-scholarship/" target="_blank">Digital Scholarship Group</a> at Northeastern Library. I am currently working on the <a href="https://crrj.org/" target="_blank">Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project</a>, the <a href="https://bostonresearchcenter.org/" target="_blank">Boston Research Center</a>, and projects with the <a href="https://www.primarysourcecoop.org/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Historical Society</a> and <a href="https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a>. I previously was a researcher and fellow in Digital Humanities at the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/research/opportunities-for-academics/fellowships/digital" target="_blank">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, and before that I worked as a student with the <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Price Lab for Digital Humanities</a> and Penn Libraries' <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/rdds" target="_blank">Research Data and Digital Scholarship</a> team. Most of my work is centered around digital tools for historical research, community history, newspapers, and 20th century history and race in America.
  - title: I have many people to thank who have been mentors, friends, and role models, including Jim English, Stewart Varner, Silvina Fernandez-Duque, Benjamin Lee, Robert Ehrenreich, Eric Schmalz, Russ Sitka, William Mattingly, Liz Polcha, and lastly Scott Enderle, whose support for me while I was a student was truly formative. Without Scott, I would have never been involved in DH, and I dedicate all my work to his kindness and thoughtfulness.
